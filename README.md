# Debugging Intellij IDEA

Repository used to demonstrate some advanced features of debugger.

Samples are in Kotlin, but works for Java as well.  
Repository is using basic language features so knowledge of Kotlin is **not** needed.

A lot of features are demonstrated in this awesome video [Practical Debugging at Scale: Do you Really Know How to Debug Effectively?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6Rn0dsfK34&ab_channel=IntelliJIDEA%2CaJetBrainsIDE)
