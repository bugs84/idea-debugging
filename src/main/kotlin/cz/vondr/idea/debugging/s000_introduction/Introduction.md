## Motivation

Debugging features are good to know.

If you don't know the feature you will not see how to use it in your situation.

In other words you must know which features you have in your "swiss army knife"
or you will never use them.

I recently checked debugger features, and I was surprised how many I didn't know

## Note

Examples are in **Kotlin**, but they are very simple. And everything works in **Java** too.
